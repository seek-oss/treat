"Unthemeable selector: div

Global styles cannot be themed unless the selector references a themed class.

For example, you could add a themed class to the start of your selector (e.g. \`\${themedClass} h1\`).

Without a reference to a themed class, there is no way to selectively apply styles based on the current theme."

The origins of treat begin with Braid, our design system.  Braid was originally built with CSS Modules, but authored in JavaScript (via css-in-js-loader). Unfortunately, we were hitting up against the limits of this approach.  Problem #1: We were unable to author our CSS Modules in TypeScript.  When you attempt to write your CSS Modules in TypeScript, you export an entire style sheet object (which then gets converted to a CSS Module by postcss-js).  For example, let's assume we have the following style sheet:    The TypeScript compiler can't make sense of this without an understanding of the transformation happening within webpack. When looking at the raw source code, this doesn't make sense from a type perspective.  As a result, even though the rest of our project was now written in TypeScript, we were forced to keep our CSS written in JavaScript. As a workaround, we generated TypeScript declaration files (via our own css-modules-typescript-loader), but it was less than ideal.  Problem #2: CSS Modules only provided a single flat namespace to work with.  We were generating themed collections of utility classes and wanted to export multiple namespaces from a single file, e.g. paddingTop, background, color, etc.  We were forced to manually namespace properties with underscores, which required a lot of boilerplate code to convert these into nested data structures (e.g. converting paddingTop_large into paddingTop.large).  TypeScript made this particularly painful because we also had to maintain type definitions for these extra translation steps.  Potential solution: Runtime CSS-in-JS?  At this point we talked about migrating to a runtime CSS-in-JS library like styled-components or Emotion. In fact, if we were starting from scratch, it's likely we would have simply reached for one of these libraries. That certainly would have solved our immediate problems.  However, we weren't starting from scratch. Instead, we were beginning to roll out our new design system to an existing, well-established ecosystem that had grown accustomed to the technical tradeoffs and runtime characteristics of CSS Modules.  Some of our projects are particularly sensitive to changes in bundle size and runtime performance, and we didn't want to negatively impact these projects from the outside. Some of our projects are even shipped as standalone JavaScript widgets into external codebases. We wanted to be sure that our new design system wouldn't come with a noticeable change in footprint.  We did leave the door open to adopting this architecture in the future, but decided that we wanted to see how far we could go with our current set of tradeoffs.  Potential solution: Static CSS-in-JS?  The next step for us was to investigate libraries like Linaria and Astroturf, which are both really interesting attempts at getting the best of both worlds—CSS-in-JS without the runtime overhead.  Unfortunately, neither of them quite fit our particular needs.  Astroturf is a really lean solution to this problem, essentially supporting CSS Modules and standard preprocessors within JavaScript template literals. That makes it much more ergonomic than more traditional approaches, but it also inherits all of the limitations we were experiencing with CSS Modules.  Linaria looked a lot more promising due to its theming support, but it came with an important caveat. Theming is achieved via CSS custom properties (i.e. CSS variables), which means that legacy browsers like IE11 are not supported. This simply wasn't an option for us.  Potential solution: Something new?  As a result, we started talking about alternative ideas. Something that could offer the theming ability of Linaria, but without the reliance on CSS variables. Something that could offer the runtime characteristics of CSS Modules, while feeling like regular JavaScript (or, in our case, TypeScript).  That's when the early ideas for treat started to emerge.  Early API designs looked promising, and initial prototypes proved that the concept could be supported by webpack. We decided to start investing in this approach—slowly at first, but ramping up as it started to further prove itself.  We continued to refine treat over several months while we simultaneously worked on Braid, with the development of one supporting the other. The code in Braid was now much more maintainable than it was before, and treat ultimately shipped to production, supporting real applications, with only a couple of minor hiccups along the way.

Conceptually, this is no different to preprocessors like Sass and Less. The difference is that, rather than using a custom domain-specific language, treat lets you use JavaScript as your preprocessor.  Within treat files, treat provides a set of styling APIs for generating CSS. Calling these APIs will result in styles being added to your application bundle. In order to expose these styles to your application code, they must be explicitly exported:    Generated styles are separately passed through the webpack loader pipeline, which allows you to create static CSS files via mini-css-extract-plugin.
